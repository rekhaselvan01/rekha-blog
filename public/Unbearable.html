    <h1>Unbearable</h1>
    <p>
        This moment right now right here is unbearable<br />
        Death o death can you come and embrace me?<br />
        O how I have dreaded you and tried to avoid you at all cost<br />
        Today right this moment, I want nothing more than your warm embrace<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        How can life change so much?<br />
        How can I want death that I wanted to escape so much?<br />
        How can I want nothing from someone I loved so much?<br />
        How can life take such unbelievable turns?<br />
        Today right this moment, I want nothing more than your warm embrace.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Take me away from all these horrible aches and sufferings<br />
        All I want is to not exist and to fade into thin air<br />
        Please come and find me if you really care<br />
        Please set me free from all these bondages<br />
        I am ready, if you are ready too, please come find me<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        I regret all the things I have done<br />
        I wish I could go back and change the way I lived<br />
        If only I knew things would turn this way.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        I wish to fly far away from all these troubles<br />
        Give me a wing to fly and donâ€™t let me come back<br />
        When you are broken and want nothing more<br />
        A warm embrace from death could mean so much more<br />
        A want so strong, need nothing no more than fading away.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Take me away, take me away, far from all these pains<br />
        I have cried a river, are you waiting for me to cry an ocean?<br />
        Never have I ever wanted you so much<br />
        Every single day  just feels like a wait to meet you<br />
        Should I keep counting days or do you care enough to come for me?<br />
    </p>
