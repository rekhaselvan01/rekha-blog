    <h1>GHOST</h1>
    <p>
        I am in love with a ghost<br />
        I looked everywhere but couldn’t find him<br />
        I looked near and far, length and breadth, but couldn’t find him<br />        
        Someone tell me you have seen him<br />
        Somebody help me find him for I am dying without him.
    </p>
    <p>
        He is so brilliant it cannot be missed<br />
        He is ever so kind and gentle its impossible to be left unnoticed<br />
        For I have felt his care and melted in his arms to be fair.<br />
        I have never felt a love so strong and gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
        It sneaked upon me without a notice<br />
        Took me by surprise and enveloped me as a whole<br />
        Never felt a love so strong and never wanted to come out of it<br />
        Came like a gentle breeze that I cannot get enough of<br />
        But left me like a dessert ravaged after a storm.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Never been able to find him ever since<br />
        Someone tell me you have seen him<br />
        For I am dying without him<br />
        Especially with people claiming that they are him<br />
        But I know I fell in love with a ghost<br />
        Where is the man I fell in love with?<br />
        Someone tell me you have seen him<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        I would give anything to have him back<br />
        Just to spend one minute in his lap<br />
        Just to hear his loving, caring words<br />
        Just to see his smile and his adorable face<br />
        Just to look into his eyes one more time<br />
        The eyes that had so much love for me<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        I am in love with a ghost<br />
        I looked everywhere but couldn’t find him<br />
        Someone tell me you have seen him<br />
        For I am dying without him<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        All that is left is his shadow<br />
        All I have is his memory<br />
        I could live a thousand lives<br />
        Just remembering the way he made me feel<br />
        oh, how I would give anything to lay in his arms<br />
        And feel his warmth, I am in love with a ghost<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Is everything just fake?<br />
        Is everything just a lie?<br />
        Why does it make me crazy enough to die?<br />
        What do I have to give in exchange to have my man?<br />
        Someone tell me you have seen him<br />
        For I am dying without him<br />
    </p>
